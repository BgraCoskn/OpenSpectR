This project is an open-source hardware, 3D printed, optical absorption scanning spectrophotometer. I'm trying to build this project out of readily available parts and use 3D printed components where I can, when finished I will add every STL, code and the guide to the best of my abilities to make it easy for anyone to make their own spectrometer.
